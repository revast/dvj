# dvj

A vj and Dj program by interim_descriptor

original release statement from 2009:
"For a decade, I've been working on a DJ + VJ program called "dvj". In short, 
it gives the user a pair of video-linked turntables: Scratching with a MIDI 
controller scratches both the audio and video. This is the only program I use 
at my shows, and I'm quite happy with it."

dvj supports projection mapping.


Current status: Last update on Googlecode repo was 2 years ago, to support OSX 10.9.

As interim_descriptor abandoned the linux version ("Linux is dependency hell") and concentrated on osx instead,
there are some platform-specific parts of code in the sources, namely mach, syphon and itunes 
integration, so building on linux is not straightforward, and does not succeed so far.

I will try to lay out the process of compiling for both platforms
as thoroughly as possible, and also provide binaries if possible.
